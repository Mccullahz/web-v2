# Zylar McCullah â€“ Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio website, a hybrid between a terminal interface and modern web UI, built entirely using **React + TypeScript**. The project showcases my work and growth as a developer, blending a UNIX-inspired terminal experience with sleek GUI pages, all deployed via **Netlify**.

## Project History

This portfolio site began in 2022 as a **static HTML/CSS/JS site** hosted on **GitHub Pages**, showcasing my personal projects with minimal interactivity.

### Timeline:

- **v1 (HTML/CSS/JS):**  
  - Deployed via GitHub Pages  
  - Static layout with basic sections

- **v2 (React + TypeScript):**  
  - Refactored into a modern React SPA  
  - Split into reusable `.tsx` components  
  - Added terminal-style CLI experience via `/portfolio`  
  - Created dynamic routing with `react-router-dom`

- **Deployment Migration:**  
  - Switched from GitHub Pages (due to SPA routing limitations)  
  - Now deployed via **Netlify** with proper SPA support  
  - Custom domain support enabled at `zylarmccullah.tech`

## Features

-  **Terminal-style CLI** interface (`/portfolio`) with mock commands such as (`help`, `run`, `info`, `gui`)
-  **GUI Project Cards** with interactive flipping effects
-  Responsive design optimized for all devices
-  Fast-loading, compiled via Vite and deployed to CDN
-  External links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and hosted project demos
